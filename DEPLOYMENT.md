# Deployment Guide - MW Brady Law Website

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the MW Brady Law website to various hosting platforms.

## üöÄ Quick Start Deployment

Netlify is the recommended hosting platform for this site due to its excellent support for JAMstack applications and automatic deployments.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
1. Create a new repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
2. Push your project code to the repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

#### Step 2: Connect to Netlify

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```
