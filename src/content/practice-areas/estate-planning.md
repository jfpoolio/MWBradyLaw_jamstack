Whether you own a business, rent a small apartment, or just bought your first home, it is important to have a plan in place. Nobody wants to work for their entire life simply to have the fruits of their hard work arbitrarily divided up by a court. Just as important is knowing that you personally selected the individual you prefer to make decisions for you if you become unable to do so for yourself.

Whether drafting a Will or Trust, or determining Powers of Attorney, we are concerned first and foremost with creating a plan that meets the goals and needs of your family. We will help you best protect your property and wealth.

Call us at (708) 532-3655 to schedule your free consultation and to learn how an estate plan can bring you and your loved ones peace of mind.

## Why Estate Planning Matters

### Protect Your Family
Without proper planning, your assets may not go to the people you intended. An estate plan ensures your wishes are followed and your loved ones are protected.

### Avoid Probate
Proper estate planning can help your family avoid the time, expense, and public nature of probate court proceedings.

### Plan for Incapacity
Powers of attorney ensure that someone you trust can make decisions for you if you become unable to do so yourself.

### Minimize Taxes
Strategic estate planning can help reduce the tax burden on your estate and beneficiaries.
